# Probability Spaces

* The event outcome space
* The bias space
* The belief in bias space
* inside the head vs outside the head

## Outside the head prob

* long run relative freq
* analyitcally determine by definition of events
  
## Inside The Head prob

* Quantifying subjective beliefs
* Calrbration relative to other probabilities
    - 10 Marble gambling example
* Assign probability distribution
    - Women's height
* Kolmorgorovs prob axioms
* Same maths for belief and long run rel freq
* Discrete vs continuous, mass vs density
* Pdf calculus derrivation.
* normal pdf
* expeced values as long run avg.
    - with calc definition
* variance
    - p(x) is like proportion of (x-E[x])^2 associated with x
* p(theta) as prob of measuring theta or credibile values for param theta
    - E[theta] typical credible value.
    - Var[theta] as uncertainty across canditate values
* Mean as central tendency derived from variance.
* Higest density interval
    - Every point inside interval has higher credibility than any point outside it. 
        - Implications for multi modal - Discontinous
* HDI width as a research concern.

# Two way distributions

* Marginals, summing/integrating out

# Conditional Probability
    
    * p(hair|eye) = bayesian inference
    * No temporal link! p(rained last night | clouds next morning)
 
# Independence
    * Disproving independence using conditional probability
